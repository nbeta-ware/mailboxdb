OPTIONS
-------

-p pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. By default the daemons use dbmail-<daemon>.pid
  for their pid files, saving them in the directory specified by the
  pid_directory entry in dbmail.conf or if that does not exist the value set by
  the configuration option --localstatedir, and will halt if the pid file
  cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to place the pid file in
  your system's preferred location.

-n::
  No daemonize: inetd mode. The program remains attached to the console from
  which it was started and will read and write on stdin/stdout. This is quite
  useful for debugging when combined with the -v option. It is also used for
  running from (x)inetd.

-D::
  No daemonize: init mode. The program remains attached to the console and will
  listen on the network sockets defined in dbmail.conf. This is mostly used 
  when running from inittab or under the control of daemontools.
