DBMAIL-UTIL(8)
==============


NAME
----
dbmail-util - maintains the integrity and cleanliness of the DBMail
datatables.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-util [-actbpds] [-l time] [-yn] [-qvVh] [-f configFile]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-util program offers a database cleanup and integrity check.
All messages set for deletion (status 2) will be marked for final deletion
(status 3). All message marked for final deletion will be cleared from the
database. The integrity check will check for unconnected mimeparts,
headervalues, messages and mailboxes.

By default, checks are read-only. Pass the -n option to respond no to any
prompts. Pass the -y option to make read-write changes, responding yes to any
prompts.

OPTIONS
-------

-c::
 Clean up unlinked message entries.

-t::
 Test for message integrity.

-b::
 Check and rebuild the body/header/envelope cache tables.

-p::
 Remove all messages with a PURGE (3) value on status field. To purge messages
 currently marked with the DELETE (2) status, run with the -pd options twice.
 This is not recommended; it is better to leave a grace period for old messages
 before permanently wiping them from the database.

-d::
 Queue all messages marked with the DELETE (2) status for final purging, by 
 setting the status value to PURGE (3). The status field is set to DELETE by
 either the IMAP-EXPUNGE or POP3-DELE commands.

-s::
 Remove dangling/invalid aliases and forwards.

-a::
 Perform the above checks: -c -t -b -p -d -s

-r time::
 Clear the reply cache used for autoreplies and Sieve vacations. The time is
 specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

-l time::
 Clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP-before-SMTP. The time is specified as
 <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

*Common options*

-n::
 Show the intended repairs without making any changes, i.e. no to all.

-y::
 Perform all repair actions , i.e. yes to all.

*Maintenance options*

--rehash::
 Rebuild the hash values for all the message parts in the database. You
 need to run this after modifying the hash_algorithm config option.

-e::
 Check for empty envelope cache.

*Migration options*

-M::

-m limit::
