## What is it?

DBMail is a collection of programs that enables email to be managed, stored in
and retrieved from a database.

**Note:** This repository contains some features that are not present in the official DBMail

## Why is it useful?

- Securely and scaleably manages user emails with industry standard IMAP;

- Integrates with existing authentication backends including ActiveDirectory
  and OpenLDAP;

- DBMail is scalable including multiple terrabyte installations;

- DBMail is flexible. You can run dbmail programs on different servers talking
  to the same database;

- Email filtering is integrated into DBMail and managed using SIEVE;

- Schema upgrades are automatic with SQL provided for DBAs who wish to upgrade
  manually;

- Easy to use and flexible logging for each service;

- An experimental Docker image is available;

- High Availability thanks to database replication and Docker images;

- Data safety thanks to database replication;

- Secure connections thanks to TLS;

- DBMail is database driven so no need of systemusers;

- No need to maintain system users or write access to the filesystem;

- DBMail is Free with a recognised GPL2 Open Source licence.

## Who created it?

DBMail was originally created by IC&S in the Netherlands.

Around 2003, Paul Stevens at NFG also joined the development team, initially to
provide debian packaging, later to take over development of the 2.1 release.
Aaron Stone also deserves special thanks for initiating the LDAP driver,
maintaining the delivery chain and of course sieve support.

DBMail is now a community effort to create a fast, effecient and scalable
database driven mailingsystem. Both IC&S and NFG are fully behind opensource
and the GPL. Therefore DBMail has the GPL licence.

[Roundcube](https://roundcube.net/) work well with IMAP using dbmail-imapd
plus Roundcube and most desktop software has integration with email filtering
via dbmail-sieved.
